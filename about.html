    <h2>About the Event</h2>

    <p>
      This is the third iteration of something I started four years ago.
      I've loved golf all my life, and I wanted to make a difference for
      those who are suffering and in serious need of help.
      I decided to use one of my favorite things in life to help facilitate
      that desire.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      This year, join us for a round of golf as we honor my sister's life,
      Jennifer. She had a serene connection to people and animals.
      She was an empath like no other, with deep compassion for everyone
      around her.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      Jennifer was bullied at a young age, which exacerbated her depression
      and anxiety as she grew older. Unfortunately, the prescriptions she
      received as a teenager did not help and instead led her to turn to
      substances while searching for answers.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      In 2022, my sister got sober from opiates. During that time, she built
      a meaningful outreach on social media to help others suffering from
      addiction. She supported people during their most painful moments,
      and without a doubt, she saved lives through her compassion.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      As often happens, negativity eventually followed the positive impact
      she made. Jennifer experienced severe harassment online, and old habits
      returned, creating an avalanche that could not be stopped.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jennifer passed away peacefully in our living room on February 28, 2023.
    </p>

    <p>
      In honor of the lives she touched and saved, this year’s fundraiser
      supports the Savage Sisters Organization — a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
      providing trauma-informed recovery housing, disease prevention,
      and statewide education on substance use disorder.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2024, Savage Sisters reached 39,740 people, distributed 13,344
      naloxone doses, and conducted 721 outreaches across the state.
    </p>

    <p>
      My sister was a Savage — and so are they.
      Let’s raise money, smash drives, and save lives, together.
