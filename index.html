		<h2>About the Event</h2>
		<p>My third iteration of something I started four years ago. I've loved golf all my life. I wanted to make a difference to those out there that are suffering and are in serious need of help. So, I decided to use one of my favorite things in life to facilitate this burning desire that I have. 

This year, join us in a round of golf as we honor my sister's life, Jennifer. My sister had a serene connection to people and animals. She was an empath like no other, and had so much passion for everyone around her. 

Jennifer was bullied at a young age, and this eccacerbated her depression and anxiety as she grew up. Unfortunately, the prescriptions that she received as a teenager did not help, and only caused her to turn to substances when she was looking for answers.

My sister got sober from opiates in 2022. Upon doing so, she accomplished a large outreach on social media to others who were currently suffering from addiction. She was there for them when they were in pain, and needed someone by their side. Without a doubt, she saved lives with her outreach.

Then, social media did it's social media thing. Negativity wanted to catch up to all the positive impact that she gave to people, and Jennifer experienced endless torture and harassment online. The old habits trickled back in, and this created an avalanche that was unable to cease.

Jennifer passed away peacefully in our living room on February 28, 2023.

In honoring the lives that she saved by her outreach, this year I am fundraising for the Savage Sisters Organization. They are a 501c(3) Nonprofit providing trauma informed recovery housing, disease prevention, and statewide education on substance abuse disorder.

In 2024, the Savage Sisters reached 39,740 people, distributed 13,344 Naloxone doses, and had 721 outreaches. 

My sister was a Savage, and so are these. Let's make raise some money and save some lives while we hit 300 yard drives.<p>
