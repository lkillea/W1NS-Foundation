    <h2>About the Event</h2>

    <p>
      My third iteration of something I started four years ago. I've loved golf all my life.
      I wanted to make a difference to those out there that are suffering and are in serious
      need of help. So, I decided to use one of my favorite things in life to facilitate this
      burning desire that I have.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      This year, join us in a round of golf as we honor my sister's life, Jennifer.
      My sister had a serene connection to people and animals. She was an empath like no other,
      and had so much passion for everyone around her.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      Jennifer was bullied at a young age, and this exacerbated her depression and anxiety as she grew up.
      Unfortunately, the strength and the age at which she was prescribed medications did not help.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      My sister got sober from opiates in 2022. Upon doing so, she accomplished a large outreach on social
      media to others who were currently suffering from addiction. She was there for them when they were
      in pain, and needed someone by their side. Without a doubt, she saved lives with her outreach.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      Then, social media did its thing. Negativity caught up to the positive impact she made, and Jennifer
      experienced a great deal of harassment. Old habits returned, creating an avalanche that could not
      be stopped.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jennifer passed away peacefully in our living room on February 28, 2023.
    </p>

    <p>
      In honoring the lives she saved, this year I am fundraising for the Savage Sisters Organization.
      They are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit providing trauma-informed recovery housing, disease prevention,
      and statewide education on substance use disorder.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2024, Savage Sisters reached 39,740 people, distributed 13,344 naloxone doses,
      and conducted 721 outreaches.
    </p>

    <p>
      My sister was a Savage — and so are they.
      Let’s raise money, save lives, and hit 300-yard drives.
